# RELOAD File Edtior

A little tool to browse, edit, and modify RELOAD files which are used by the [OHRRPGCE](https://rpg.hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/Main_Page) game engine.

# Okay but why?

I found a cute game made in this engine and wanted to mod the game a bit or play around with some save data to see what I could make it do. Maybe some game developers using this engine would enjoy being able to create developer saves with free stuff or specific stats?
